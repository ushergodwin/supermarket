#Contributing

Hi there! Thanks for considering a contribution to BooBoo. We'd be glad to have your help with this project!

Here are a few guidelines to follow when preparing your contribution or creating an issue.

## Creating Issues
If you find bugs, or want feature improvements, please create a GitHub issue. 

For bugs, please include what you did, what happened, and what should have happened. This helps us figure out the cause
and fix it.

For feature improvements, please explain what you want to do, what you want to happen, and why you think this would be a
good addition to the library (over, say, a plugin you write for your own use). 

## Submitting Patches

Patches are always welcome. Patches from contributors is the foundation of open source!

As a general rule, please include tests to cover your patch, fix or feature. Pull requests without tests won't be
rejected out of hand, but patches **with** tests are easier to analyze and accept. 

We use PHPUnit as our testing framework. You can see examples of tests in the tests/ directory.

In addition, please conform your code to the PSR-1 and PSR-2 standards. Our code build process will break if your code
does not conform to this standard, and we won't be able to accept your patch. 

Thank you for your contribution!
